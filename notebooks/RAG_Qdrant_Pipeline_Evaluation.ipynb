Revenue on a constant\n1\ncurrency basis would have increased 23% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $24.22 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on ínance leases, were $8.47\nbillion.\nCapital return program – Share repurchases were $6.32 billion of our Class A common stock and dividend\npayments were $1.27 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were\n$58.08 billion as of June 30, 2024. Free cash îow was $10.90 billion.\nHeadcount – Headcount was 70,799 as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of 1% year-over-year.\n \nCFO Outlook Commentary\n \n \nWe expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5-41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign\ncurrency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For\nReality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our\nongoing product development eìorts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWhile we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect\ninfrastructure costs will be a signiícant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and\noperating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior\nrange of $35-40 billion. While we continue to reíne our plans for next year, we currently expect signiícant capital\nexpenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artiícial intelligence research and product development\neìorts.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory\nheadwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could signiícantly impact our business and our ínancial results.\n \nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n \n \nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of\n2\nMeta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along\nwith the earnings press release, ínancial tables, and slide presentation. \nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing\nequity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\n \n \nDisclosure Information\n \n \nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page\n(facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads proíle (threads.net/zuck) as means\nof disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n \n \nAbout Meta\n \n \nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, índ communities, and grow businesses.

These and other potential\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to diìer from the results predicted are more fully detailed\nunder the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q íled with the SEC on April 25, 2024, which is\navailable on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional\ninformation will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In\naddition, please note that the date of this press release is July 31, 2024, and any forward-looking statements\ncontained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no\nobligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled\n\"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report íled with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated ínancial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP ínancial\nmeasures: revenue excluding foreign exchange eìect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange eìect, and\nfree cash îow. The presentation of these ínancial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for, or superior to, ínancial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are\ncautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP ínancial measures as an\nanalytical tool. In addition, these measures may be diìerent from non-GAAP ínancial measures used by other\ncompanies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing\nspeciíc information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP ínancial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP ínancial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the\n4\nínancial performance of our business, enable comparison of ínancial results between periods where certain items\nmay vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics\nused by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP ínancial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange eìect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 using\nthe prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we\nbelieve is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on ínance leases. We subtract both purchases of\nproperty and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on ínance leases in our calculation of free cash\nîow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we\nneed to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a\nínance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors\nbetter understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash îow is not intended to represent our residual cash\nîow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP ínancial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures,\nplease see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n \nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\n \nThree Months Ended June 30,  Six Months Ended June 30,\n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n2024\n \n2023\nRevenue\n$           39,071  \n$           31,999  $           75,527  $           60,645\nCosts and expenses:\n  \n  \n  \n \nCost of revenue\n7,308  \n5,945  \n13,948  \n12,054\nResearch and development\n10,537  \n9,344  \n20,515  \n18,725\nMarketing and sales\n2,721  \n3,154  \n5,285  \n6,198\nGeneral and administrative (1)\n3,658  \n4,164  \n7,114  \n7,049\nTotal costs and expenses\n24,224  \n22,607  \n46,862  \n44,026\nIncome from operations\n14,847  \n9,392  \n28,665  \n16,619\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n259  \n(99)  \n624  \n(19)\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n15,106  \n9,293  \n29,289  \n16,600\nProvision for income taxes\n1,641  \n1,505  \n3,455  \n3,102\nNet income\n$           13,465  \n$              7,788  $           25,834  $           13,498\n5\nEarnings per share:\n  \n  \n  \n \nBasic\n$               5.31  \n$                3.03  $             10.17  $               5.24\nDiluted\n$               5.16  \n$                2.98  $               9.86  $               5.18\nWeighted-average shares used to compute earnings per share:   \n  \n  \n  \n \nBasic\n2,534  \n2,568  \n2,540  \n2,577\nDiluted\n2,610  \n2,612  \n2,619  \n2,604\n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The second quarter 2024 general and administrative expenses include a charge for the recent settlement with the State of Texas.
